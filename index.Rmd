## Project thoughts

I am interested in using the data set "Party Variation in Religiosity and Womens Leadership, Lebanon Dataset" to measure the relationship between party religiosity and share of women in party membership (perc) in Lebanon. Based on the results, I will examine the extent that party religiosity is associated with female membership, or lack thereof.
